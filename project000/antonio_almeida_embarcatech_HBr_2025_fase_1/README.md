# 🚀 EmbarcaTech 2025 - Phase I 

## 📚 Objective
This repository presents the initial Embedded Systems projects developed during EmbarcaTech 2025 - Phase I at HBr Campinas. It includes foundational code, tests, basic documentation, and essential resources that laid the groundwork for the advanced implementations in Phase II.

---

## ⚠️ Important Note:
You may need to adjust the `CMakeLists.txt` file according to your development environment, as each setup might differ based on the developer's system configuration. Without these adjustments, the code may not behave as expected.

### 📌 Description

- This initial test consists of blinking an LED using the Raspberry Pi Pico. It simulates the use of GPIOs that will activate LED_PIN_LIGHT (a heat-generating light source) and LED_PIN_FAN (a fan that removes hot air from the environment).
- The code was developed in C/C++ and tested in the Bitdoglab environment.

### 🚀 Adicionando teste0006 Bitdoglab - dh22_bdl

### 📌 Description

- His initial test consists of using Button A and Button B to activate the RGB LED when pressed, using the Raspberry Pi Pico.
- The code was developed in C/C++ and tested in the Bitdoglab environment.

- The code structure allows for efficient interchangeability, demonstrating how the separation of responsibilities between functionalities enables parts of the system to be reused in different solutions. In this way, the chassis itself can serve as a foundation for new applications, even if they have completely different functionalities.

- Key benefits of this approach
    ✔ Code reuse – Reduces rework and improves efficiency.
    ✔ Faster development – Solutions can be built quickly.
    ✔ Cost reduction – Less time and effort required.
    ✔ Quality assurance – Code already tested and validated.

- This strategy not only optimizes development but also makes systems more modular, scalable, and sustainable in the long run. 🚀

- This application could easily serve as the main project for the final delivery...

- The code was developed in C/C++ and tested in the Bitdoglab environment.
