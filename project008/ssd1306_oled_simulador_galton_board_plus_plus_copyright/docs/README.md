# 📊 The Galton Board – A Physical Simulation of the Normal Distribution

## 🧬 Overview

The **Galton Board**, also known as the **Quincunx**, is a physical device invented by Sir **Francis Galton** in the 19th century to demonstrate the **central limit theorem** and the emergence of the **normal distribution** from random processes. 

Balls fall through an array of pins, bouncing randomly left or right before collecting in bins at the bottom. When many balls are released, the resulting histogram approaches the **bell curve** – a visual manifestation of **Gaussian statistics** in action.

## ⚙️ Physical and Mathematical Principles

### 🔁 Binomial Process

Each ball's path is determined by a series of **binary choices** (left/right). This process is mathematically equivalent to a **binomial distribution**:

\[
P(k) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1 - p)^{n-k}
\]

Where:
- `n` = total number of levels
- `k` = number of right turns
- `p` = probability of turning right (typically 0.5)

As the number of levels increases, the **binomial distribution converges to a normal distribution** due to the **central limit theorem**.

### 📐 Geometry of the Board

- The pins are arranged in **staggered rows**, creating a triangular grid.
- At each pin, the ball has an **equal chance of deflecting left or right**.
- The bottom bins represent the **sum of lateral displacements**.

## 🧪 Statistical Significance

### 📈 Central Limit Theorem (CLT)

The Galton Board offers a tangible demonstration of the **CLT**, which states:

> The sum of a large number of independent, identically distributed random variables tends toward a normal distribution, regardless of the original distribution.

In the context of the board:
- Each bounce is an independent trial.
- The final position is the sum of these random variables.
- The distribution of final positions (bins) forms the **Gaussian bell curve**.
