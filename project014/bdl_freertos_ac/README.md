# Project: Multitasking System with FreeRTOS on Raspberry Pi Pico

This project implements an embedded multitasking system on the BitDogLab (Raspberry Pi Pico), using the real-time operating system **FreeRTOS**.  
The system is developed in **C** language using the **Pico SDK** and **VSCode**, focusing on task concurrency to control basic peripherals.

## üéØ Features

- Cyclic control of an **RGB LED** (green ‚Üí blue ‚Üí red).
- Periodic **beeping via buzzer**.
- Two physical buttons:
  - **Button A (GP5)**: Pauses/resumes the LED task.
  - **Button B (GP6)**: Pauses/resumes the buzzer task.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Setup

### Prerequisites

- Raspberry Pi Pico SDK properly configured
- CMake
- `arm-none-eabi-gcc` toolchain
- VSCode with C/C++ extension
- FreeRTOS Kernel

### How to Add FreeRTOS

1. Download from the official website:  
   üëâ [FreeRTOS Download](https://www.freertos.org/Documentation/02-Kernel/01-About-the-FreeRTOS-kernel/03-Download-freeRTOS/01-DownloadFreeRTOS)

2. Copy the following folders and files to your project:
   - `Source/include/`
   - `Source/portable/GCC/RISC-V/`
   - `Source/list.c`, `Source/queue.c`, `Source/tasks.c`

3. Organize them inside your `freertos/` directory accordingly.
